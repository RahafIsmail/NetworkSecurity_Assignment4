For this assignment, I will write the code in JAVA, and I am planning to write 4 functions:
1-  The first function will check whether the number is prime or not.
2-  The second function will return the factors. 
3-  The third function will return the number of iterations using the first method.
4-  The last function will return the number of iterations using the second method.
